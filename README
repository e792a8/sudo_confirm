sudo_confirm

This sudo plugin gives you a final chance to check the actual command
before executing it.

INSTALL

Run:

    make

If everything goes well, there should be a sudo_confirm.so in this directory.
Copy it into /usr/lib/sudo/. Then you should add a line into /etc/sudo.conf
to enable this plugin:

    Plugin sudo_confirm sudo_confirm.so

You may need to create /etc/sudo.conf if it does not already exist.

    !NOPW +  LAZY         = !PRIV +  SICK
     MANL +  NOPW         =  HAPY
     NOPW +  IMPL         = !AWAR
     IMPL + !AWAR         =  SICK
     MALW +  CHEK         = !DNGR +  SICK
     MALW +  IMPL + !AWAR =  DNGR
     CFRM                 =  AWAR
     AWAR +  NOPW         = !DNGR +  HAPY
